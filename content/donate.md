## Equipment

**Got something awesome you want us to have?** If you have equipment that you'd like to donate, please have a look at our [Wishlist page](/wishlist/) to see what we're in need of and how equipment donations work at BrainSilo.


## Money

**Money burning a hole through your pocket?** BrainSilo is always happy to receive cash donations!  There is a donation box in the space, next to the main door.  Alternatively, talk to one of our organizers for handling larger donations.

<!--
**[Please go here to donate to BrainSilo!](https://???/donate)**
-->

Your cash donation will go to helping us pay for rent and utilities, purchase equipment and supplies and put on events, meetups and classes!


## Volunteering

**Don't have things or money to donate but want to help?** We're always looking for people to help us clean and move things, produce events and do odd jobs. If that's interesting to you, please let us know your availability on our [Google Group][google-group].

**Have a particular skill?** Then you might want to consider [teaching at BrainSilo](/about/teaching/).


## About Your Donation


### Tax Receipt

Since we're a fiscally-sponsored project of the School Factory, Inc. a 501(c)3 tax-exempt corporation, we can offer tax receipts for valid donations we accept and that are valued. Tax receipts are for relatively large donations. If you donate some post-its(R), we're not going to give you a tax receipt.

*If you want a tax receipt for your donation, please let us know otherwise no receipt will be issued!*


### Reimbursements

PASCAL does not offer any reimbursements for donations. If you'd like to donate something to BrainSilo and want something in return, the only thing we can offer is a tax receipt (and our thanks!).
