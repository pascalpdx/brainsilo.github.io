PASCAL is the Portland Area Scientific and Cultural Advancement League, a 501\(c\)3 nonprofit organization founded to serve the information security community, educate the interested and the under-served, and to provide a venue for related gatherings, events, and projects.

PASCAL's venue, a hackerspace and community event space, is located less than one mile SE from the Moda Center, directly between (and under) the Hawthorne Bridge ramps.
