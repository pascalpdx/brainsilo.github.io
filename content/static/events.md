PASCAL opens to the public on the second Saturday of every month, and regularly holds other public events throughout the month. You are welcome to come to public events if you are not a paying member at PASCAL.

During the "Open Days", please visit PASCAL to see what we are up to, take a tour of the space itself, and learn more about our mission and goals.

[Calagator](https://calagator.org/) is a all-volunteer run effort to aggregate public programming and events relevant to the technology community in Portland, OR. You can find PASCAL events imported from [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pascalhackerspace/) onto Calagator. 

PASCAL is also available as a space to host your own events, please contact us at [events@pascalpdx.org](mailto:events@pascalpdx.org).
