      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve redesigned the site for better readability and to make updates easier. We have always been using Hugo in the development of our site, but the previous page was difficult to update and navigate. To make things clearer, we have migrated to the &amp;lsquo;Minimal&amp;rsquo; theme (link below).
As always, our website is hosted on Github, where comments, suggestions and changes can be proposed. Click the Github logo in the top right corner of the page to get started with that.</description>

      <description>PASCAL is overseen by a board. We technically have to be to be a nonprofit organization. Those board members serve two year terms and are self-governed, meaning new board members are voted for, and current board members can be reaffirmed by, the current board. Board members serve staggered two year terms, with no specific term limit.
Our board meetings are typically held at least once a month, usually in the hackerspace itself.</description>
