      <title>The PASCAL Board</title>

      <description>PASCAL is overseen by a board. We technically have to be to be a nonprofit organization. Those board members serve two year terms and are self-governed, meaning new board members are voted for, and current board members can be reaffirmed by, the current board. Board members serve staggered two year terms, with no specific term limit.
Our board meetings are typically held at least once a month, usually in the hackerspace itself.</description>
