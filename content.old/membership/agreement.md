title: "Membership Agreement & Liability Release"
---

If you're interested in becoming a member, please read our **Membership Agreement** and **Liability Release** all the way through and make sure that you can abide by them as a member.

## Membership Agreement
**Shop Hours:** BrainSilo will be open to members 24/7, except for occasional special events.

**Payment**: If you are not using BrainSilo's online payment service (via meetup.com), then monthly fees are due on the 1st of the month, and late after the 5th.  Memberships can be put on hiatus and revived at a later month but this must be communicated in writing with [BrainSilo leadership](/about/leadership).

**Volunteering**: All members are encouraged, but not required, to volunteer at least 3 hours per month in order to benefit, grow, and provide upkeep to BrainSilo.

**Cleaning and Lockup**: All members are responsible for cleaning up after themselves including properly storing projects. When leaving for the day, members must lockup the space if they are the last ones out. This includes locking doors, turning off lights and power, and taking out any full or odorous garbage.

#### Ethical and Behavioral Guidelines
BrainSilo does not have a "Safe Space Policy", "Anti-harassment policy" or similar.  Instead, we presume that our members are adults, and assume they can act as such.  BrainSilo's goal is to provide a productive environment for work, learning, and creativity for its members; we do not act as parents, tell you what you should wear, or tell you what language to use or not to use.

With that said, we do have some general best practices:

 - Individual Safety: Consider all posted signs and literature pertaining to safe use of our facilities. These include but are not limited to: signs regarding appropriate shop clothing and protective gear, techniques for safe equipment use, material-specific precautions for equipment, and machine tool lockouts. Do not use equipment you are not comfortable with or trained to use.
 - Shared Safety: In a shared and open facility like ours, it is possible for less experienced members to operate equipment dangerously without knowing it. Please stay on the lookout for unsafe behavior, and approach and offer feedback to fellow members if you believe they are working unsafely. Please notify staff immediately if you believe any piece of equipment or infrastructure to be unsafe.
 - Respectful Behavior: In both face to face and electronic interactions, behave respectfully, courteously, and professionally to your fellow members. Though we greatly value free speech, verbal discrimination, harassment, or hate speech that is directed at another individual is strongly discouraged; any physical harassment is one of the few grounds for expulsion from the space.
 - Tolerance of Feedback: Please be open to constructive feedback from fellow members, especially as it pertains to safe use of our equipment and disrespectful communication or behavior.
