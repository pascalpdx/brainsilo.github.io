## Membership FAQ


### What Equipment Do You Have?

Check out our [Equipment page](/about/equipment/) for an updated list of our equipment.


### What Volunteer Commitment Are You Looking For?

We don't have a hard requirement on volunteering. We want members to take the initiative to find things that need to be done at BrainSilo.

If the trash needs to be taken out, then take it out. If a station is messy, clean it up. If you need a piece of equipment, then help us acquire it. If you want to start doing X at BrainSilo, then make it happen (as long as it's relatively safe and legal)!


### What Membership Commitment Do You Require?

At this time, we don't require any membership commitment though we ask you to give us a heads up if you're going to cancel.


### What Is The Cancellation Policy?

You can cancel at any time with no penalty.

If you'd like to cancel your membership, please [email us](mailto:admin@brainsilo.org).


### Are There Any Setup Fees

At this point, there are no setup fees to become a member. We may decide to change this in the future if we deem it necessary.


### Are There Any Other Fees?

Not at the moment...

### Guests

Our current guest policy is that any member may bring in guests, but guests are encouraged to become members if they are utilizing the space often - ideas for incentivizing this switch are welcome. Guests must be accompanied by a member.

### Members of other Hackerspaces

If you are a member of a hackerspace that is not in the metro area, then you are probably welcome to use our space while you are in town - just [contact us](/contact/).

We are also open to the idea of formal reciprocal membership with other hackerspaces.
