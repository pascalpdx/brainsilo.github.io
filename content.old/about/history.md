## Founding & Early Days

The idea of a hackerspace in Portland was a recurring theme at BarCamp and other unconferences and meetups since at least 2008, but very little progress was made until space was rented in 2010.  On January 1st, 2010 [Loki](/about/leadership/) signed a lease on space he and Cat had found in an industrial area of Portland.

Originally just called "PDX Hackerspace", it took a few months for an organization to be created - BrainSilo.

## Today

We're still operating in our original, 850 sq.ft. space, and we're open to members 24/7.

## Tomorrow

Our story is continually evolving and if we remember, we'll keep this page updated as we go!
